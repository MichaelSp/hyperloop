## Hyperloop - The Complete Isomorphic Ruby Framework

Hyperloop works great with new or existing rails apps, so it's pain free to introduce it to your application.

Hyperloop has been tested with the most recent Ruby On Rails verions:<br> Rails (4.2), Rails (5.0) and the last Rails (5.1.0.rc1).


### Setup

In your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'hyperloop'
```

then

```ruby
bundle install
```

Once the Hyperloop Gem and all its dependencies have been installed, it's time to run the hyperloop install generator.

```ruby
rails g hyperloop:install
```
